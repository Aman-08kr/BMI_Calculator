This project calculates your Body Mass Index (BMI) using your height (in cm) and weight (in kg), providing an accurate assessment of your current health status. Based on the BMI result, it will categorize your weight condition as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this tool is both easy to use and visually engaging, helping you better understand your BMI and take steps toward maintaining or improving your overall health.
